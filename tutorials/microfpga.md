# MicroFPGA

MicroFPGA is an electronic platform generating signals that are commonly needed when controlling a microscope. It is based on the Au and Cu FPGA (Alchitry).

The available signals are the following:

| Name            | I/O    | Function                                                     | Default number |
| --------------- | ------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------: |
| Laser trigger   | Output | Triggering lasers based on the processing of an input camera signal. Can be used for pattern triggering or microsecond pulsing of lasers. |       8        |
| TTL             | Output | TTL signals are either HIGH or LOW, and can be used to control devices such as flip-mirrors or switches. |       5        |
| Servo           | Output | Servos signals are periodic digital signals (20 ms period and 1 to 2 ms pulses) used commonly to move servomotors. The MicroFPGA servo signals are turned off after 10 ms in order to prevent vibrations. |       7        |
| PWM             | Output | PWM signals are similar to the Servo signals, except they are not switched off after 10 s. Together with a low-pass electronic filter, they can be used to produce analog signals, used for instance with AOTFs. |       5        |
| Analog read-out | Input  | Analog inputs are limited to 0-1 V and can be used to monitor signals from the microscope, e.g. temperature, laser position, laser power... |   8 (fixed)    |

### Laser trigger

Cameras (whether EMCCD or sCMOS) are usually delivered with an output cable to trigger devices. The trigger output is a TTL signal (high/low) that notifies the devices when the camera is registering the pixel values or when it is exposing. Directly connecting the camera trigger to the laser input trigger has the advantage to prevent unnecessary exposure of the sample to laser light: the laser is only emitting when the camera is exposing. 

However, direct triggering is not flexible. MicroFPGA act as a camera signal modulator to produce a laser trigger that can be pulsed or synchronized between lasers, including complex patterns. The camera signal must be provided to the FPGA (refer to the [pins mapping](pins_br.md)).

:warning: **Do not supply the camera signal with more than 3.3V to the FPGA** :warning:

EMCCD often have a 5 V trigger. Therefore, the camera trigger needs to be scaled down to 3.3 V prior to the FPGA. sCMOS cameras trigger usually runs on 3.3 V.

MicroFPGA offers several trigger mode:

| Trigger mode |         Parameters         |                         Description                          |
| :----------: | :------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|     OFF      |                            |                   The laser is always off                    |
|      ON      |                            |                    The laser is always on                    |
|    RISING    | **duration<br />sequence** | The laser is pulsed for **<duration>** micro-seconds, on each **rising** edge |
|   FALLING    | **duration<br />sequence** | The laser is pulsed for **<duration>** micro-seconds, on each **falling** edge |
|    CAMERA    |        **sequence**        |             The laser follows the camera trigger             |

You need to only provide a single camera input. In addition to **mode** and **duration**, a third parameter can be set: **sequence**. The **sequence** corresponds to a 16 bits number (0 to 65535) which encodes a trigger sequence in its bits sequence. MicroFPGA reads the binary number from the most-significant bit to the least significant one. If the bit is 1, then the laser will be triggered during the next camera exposure. If it is 0, it will not. The sequence is applied in **RISING**, **FALLING** and **CAMERA** modes. The lasers are synchronized, allowing alternating triggering.

### TTL

TTL signals are often used to set a device on/off or in/out. A typical use are electronic flip-mirrors, in which a TTL low sets the mirror to its _out_ position, and a TTL high to its _in_ position.

| Property | Value |
| :------: | :---: |
|    ON    |   1   |
|   OFF    |   0   |

### Servo

Servos typically require three signals: power, ground and position. We advise supplying the power with another device than the FPGA to avoid drawing too little current, while connecting the source ground to the FPGA.

A [servo position signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_control "Wikipedia Servo control") is usually a PWM signal between 1ms and 2 ms, with a period of 20 ms. MicroFPGA follows this standard with a pulse width resolution of 16 bits:

| Position | Value |
| :------: | :---: |
| Minimum  |   0   |
| Maximum  | 65535 |

Additionally, MicroFPGA turns off the servo signal after 10 seconds in order to avoid vibrations on the optical table.

### PWM

PWMs are similar to the servo signals, but are not switched off. MicroFPGA uses 8 bits values (0-255) to set the duty cycle value and a period of 1.3 ms. PWMs are particularly interesting as they can be used to create an analog signal using a low-pass filter.

### Analog read-out

Analog inputs are only available with the Au FPGA.

:warning:  **Do not supply inputs with more than 1.8V to the AU FPGA analog inputsâ€‹ :warning: **

MicroFPGA has eight analog read-out pins. Using the Au FPGA, you can read-out the measured voltage scaled to 0-65535:

| Reading | Voltage |
| :-----: | :-----: |
|    0    |   0 V   |
|  65535  |   1 V   |
